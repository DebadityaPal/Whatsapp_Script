## Whatsapp Script
This is a Python Script built on the Selenium framework to automate messaging on Whatsapp (Web), the popular chatting app.

Hence, you would first need to have selenium installed before running the script which can easily be done using the following command in the command line.

    pip install selenium

There is also an option to send attachments with the message. All types of files can be sent. The default number of attachments is 3, however this can be edited as per personal requirements.

Before running the script add all contacts to your phone and import the CSV file and get the list of names using contactList.py.
Modify the required part of the code in whatsapp.py.

Steps to run the code:
1. Open the CLI and cd to the Script Directory.
2. Run the command 
`python whatsapp.py`
3. Scan the QR code when Web Whatsapp opens (it should open automatically). 
4. Press any key in the CLI to start the script.
